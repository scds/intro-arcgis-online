# Welcome to Introduction to GIS (ArcGIS Online) 

Synchronous Workshop | February 17, 2022

If youâ€™ve ever thought that a map would help illustrate a critical part of your research, this workshop is for you. This beginner-friendly session introduces participants to the core concepts of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial data, then shows how to apply these concepts during a hands-on exercise where you will create a web-based map in ArcGIS Online.
